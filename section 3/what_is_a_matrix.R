# Matrices are two-dimensional array that can hold numeric, character or logical values. 
# The elements in a matrix all have the same data type.
#
# A matrix is arranged into a fixed number of rows and columns. Since you are only 
# working with rows and columns, thus a matrix is called two-dimensional.
