# Consider the following arithmetic operators:
# - Addition: +
# - Subtraction: -
# - Multiplication: *
# - Division: /
# - Exponentiation: ^
# - Modulo: %%
#   
# The last two might need some explaining:
# 
# - The ^ operator raises the number to it1s left to the power of 
#   the number to its right: for example 3^2 is 9.
# - The modulo returns the remainder of the division of the number 
#   to the left by the number on its right, for example 5 modulo 3 or 5 %% 3 is 2.

# An addition
5 + 5 

# A subtraction
5 - 5 

# A multiplication
3 * 5

# A division
(5 + 5) / 2 

# Exponentiation
2 ^ 5

# Modulo
28 %% 6
